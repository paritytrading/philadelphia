# Philadelphia

Philadelphia is a fast Financial Information Exchange (FIX) protocol library
for the JVM.

You can use Philadelphia to connect to stock exchanges, brokerage firms, and
other network endpoints that use the FIX protocol. You can also use it to
provide your own services using the FIX protocol.

Philadelphia is designed to exhibit low and predictable latency. To achieve
this, it supports non-blocking networking and does not allocate memory on
message reception or transmission.

Philadelphia requires Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 11 or newer.
